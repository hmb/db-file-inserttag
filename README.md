This is a Contao extension, that provides an insert tag which converts
a file ID of the database powered filesystem into it's path representation.
The insert tag can be used in custom HTMl or TinyMCE Text blocks to link
to a file independently of it's physical path, unleashing the power of
the database powered filesystem.

The extenstion is licensed unter LGPLv3.
